# Autonomous-Cleaning-Robot
An Arduino-powered autonomous cleaning robot that navigates surfaces, detects obstacles and edges, and connects to mobile devices via Bluetooth for control and monitoring. This project combines hardware design, embedded programming, and a React Native-based interface to provide a smart cleaning solution.
