# Autonomous-Cleaning-Robot
This project is an autonomous cleaning robot powered by an Arduino microcontroller, equipped with ultrasonic sensors for navigation and mapping. The robot uses a 2D grid-based mapping algorithm to detect obstacles and edges, ensuring efficient exploration and navigation of the surface. The mapping data is stored in a 2D array and visualized for debugging. The robot can be turned on and off using a mobile application through bluetooth communication. This project combines hardware design, embedded programming, and a React Native-based mobile app interface to provide a smart cleaning solution.
